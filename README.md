# Block_Disintegreter-v0.1-

The Block Disintegreter is a replica of the Arcanoid game by the Atari back in the 80s.
-v0.1- still have a plethora of malfunctions which are going to be fixed in the upcoming time. For now, the main functions such as paddle/block/ball collision, and powerups are working the way they are intented to.
There is still no "New Game" or "Game Over" functions. Consequently, the game can be terminated merely via windows close button.
